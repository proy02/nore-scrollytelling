## How the project was developed
The spatial data was processed on QGIS and exported as an .svg from Adobe Illustrator for better control during interactivity. Finally, for web development I chose Svelte as it lightweight and super elegant and just less code! 

Finally, a lot AI-assisted debugging was involved during the web develpment process.
